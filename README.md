# Stata D3 Examples
This is a submodule of d3mata to show how Mata functions can be used to create templates to quickly/easily generate D3js based data visualizations from Stata.

The submodule repo should be the primary location for contributions since it will allow more users to quickly develop and share different D3js based graphs and/or helper functions (e.g., a Mata function that generates the JavaScript for helpful tool tips that could then be easily inserted/combined with other/existing graphs for extensibility).
