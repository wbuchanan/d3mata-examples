# Stata D3 Examples
These examples are being updated little by little to reflect changes in the [jsonio](https://wbuchanan.github.io/StataJSON) and in preparation for the 2016 North American Stata Users Group Meeting in Chicago.  

## Examples
The examples page will evolve over time, but there is currently a single example that shows output generated by the d3scatterTip Mata function defined in this repository.  After converting the auto.dta dataset to JSON using [jsonio](http://wbuchanan.github.io/StataJSON/about/) and defining the d3scatterTip Mata function, the graph was created using the code:

```   
mata: d3scatterTip("~/Desktop/Programs/StataPrograms/d/d3/examples//index.html", ///   
		   "data/auto.json", "length", "gear_ratio", "foreign", "make")
```   

The example above can be viewed on the [project page](http://wbuchanan.github.io/d3mata-examples/).  If, for example, we wanted to generate the points colored based on the number of repairs in the `rep78` variable, it would be as simple as:

```
mata: d3scatterTip("~/Desktop/Programs/StataPrograms/d/d3/examples//index.html", ///   
                   "data/auto.json", "length", "gear_ratio", "rep78", "make")
```
