# Stata D3 Examples
This is a submodule of d3mata to show how Mata functions can be used to create templates to quickly/easily generate D3js based data visualizations from Stata.

The submodule repo should be the primary location for contributions since it will allow more users to quickly develop and share different D3js based graphs and/or helper functions (e.g., a Mata function that generates the JavaScript for helpful tool tips that could then be easily inserted/combined with other/existing graphs for extensibility).

## Examples
The examples page will evolve over time, but there is currently a single example that shows output generated by the d3scatterTip Mata function defined in this repository.  After converting the auto.dta dataset to JSON using [jsonio](http://wbuchanan.github.io/StataJSON/about/) and defining the d3scatterTip Mata function, the graph was created using the code:

```   
mata: d3scatterTip("~/Desktop/Programs/StataPrograms/d/d3/examples//index.html", ///   
		   "data/auto.json", "length", "gear_ratio", "foreign", "make")
```   

The example above can be viewed on the [project page](http://wbuchanan.github.io/d3mata-examples/).  If, for example, we wanted to generate the points colored based on the number of repairs in the `rep78` variable, it would be as simple as:

```
mata: d3scatterTip("~/Desktop/Programs/StataPrograms/d/d3/examples//index.html", ///   
                   "data/auto.json", "length", "gear_ratio", "rep78", "make")
```
